## User Story

```

This application allows you to create an account and search through the United States and Washington D.C.  Once you have made a state selection you are presented with a list of historical locations, national parks, and interesting places to visit in that given state.  You can also create blog posts about the things you have seen or done.  When you login you will also get weather forecast for your current location.
